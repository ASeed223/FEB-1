Hi Team,

Please be advised that we will be performing a scheduled upgrade for Nexus this Thursday, February 12.

Start Time: 8:15 AM

Target Completion: 12:00 PM (Noon)

During this window, Nexus will be unavailable. If the upgrade is not successful, we will roll back to the system snapshot to ensure service continuity.

We will reply to this email once the upgrade is complete and Nexus is available for use again.

Thank you,
