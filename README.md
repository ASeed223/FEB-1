Good morning everyone,

Yesterday I spent most of the day continuing the Nexus cleanup with Brandon and Edgar. By the end of the day, we were able to recover another 200 GB of disk space, so we shouldn’t need to worry about Nexus disk space for a while.

In addition, I worked on an Ansible playbook to copy the PostgreSQL database backup from lxpd195 to lxpd211 to keep the database in sync.

Today, I’ll continue focusing on that task and will also be attending a few meetings.

That’s my plan for today.
