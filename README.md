Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, besides meetings, I removed the Log4j plugin in fp936 to remediate the vulnerability. Other than that, I started working on the Ansible playbook to copy the PostgreSQL database backup from lxpd195 to lxpd211 to keep the database in sync.
As for today, I’ll be meeting with Chris to go over the batchclient password change, then preparing for the Nexus upgrade tonight. Hopefully everything goes smoothly.That’s my plan for today.
