Good morning everyone,

Yesterday after the morning meeting, I finished the wiki documentation on managing the secret encryption key in Nexus. I also created an additional task to set up the encryption key for the upcoming Nexus upgrade next Friday. Other than that, I helped upload nine Pega ZIP files to dev3 and tst3 before logging off.

As for today, I have several meetings to attend, and I will focus on the onlinehelp deployment later this afternoon. That's my plan for today.
