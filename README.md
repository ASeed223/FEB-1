Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me.
Yesterday, besides meetings, I mainly spent the day preparing for the upcoming Nexus upgrade on Thursday. I created all the relevant tasks and the POR, and thanks to Jay for reviewing and approving the POR.

As for today, I’ll do a final check on my end to make sure all the files are configured correctly and ready for tomorrow’s upgrade, and I’ll also finish up the IQ Server pipeline upgrade task.

That’s my plan for today.
