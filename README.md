Hi Jay,

I just started the rsync command on lxpd195. I’ve set a 100MB/s rate limit to minimize any performance impact. If this causes any issues, we can stop the process by running kill 1845050 on lxpd195. I will keep the task updated as we progress.

I'm not sure exactly how long this will take yet. I’ll be logging off around 2:45 PM for an errand, but I will be back online tonight to check if the sync finished successfully. If not, I’ll run another rsync before I go to bed. Also, please let me know if I still need to send out an email to inform others about the upcoming Nexus upgrade.
