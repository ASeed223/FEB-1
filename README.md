Good morning everyone,

Last Friday, I was able to run the updated Ansible playbook to upgrade Nexus HA to the latest version that was released last week. Other than that, I investigated a potential solution for setting up the secret encryption key to remediate the error we saw after the upgrade, since newer versions of Nexus require configuring a Master Encryption Key to encrypt and protect sensitive credentials.

As for today, it’s pretty much the same — I’ll continue working on that and also start updating the IQ scan pipeline to scan the newer branch for the security team.

That’s my plan for today.
