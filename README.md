Nexus Upgrade Status Update
Hi team, I want to provide a quick update on the Nexus upgrade. Nexus is now successfully up and running, but I’ve identified a display issue where the "Browse" UI appears empty. I believe this is a known side effect of how the new version handles indexing via the pg_trgm extension.
I want to emphasize that this is strictly a display issue within the web interface. I’ve already verified with Nemai and Anatoliy from the OCP team and they confirmed that pulling images is working perfectly, so this should not cause any production outages.
To fix the UI, I have initiated the Repair - Rebuild repository browse and Repair - Rebuild repository search tasks in Nexus. Because we have over 2.5 TB of data, this rebuild process will take a significant amount of time to complete. But if the UI is still not populated by tomorrow, I will generate a Sonatype Support Zip and open a ticket with their engineering team for a deeper look. Since we have snapshots saved for 7 days, so we can discuss a restore if is necessary on Monday.
