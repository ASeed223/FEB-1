Hi everyone,

The Nexus upgrade was unsuccessful due to an unexpected issue. Nexus has been rolled back to the previous snapshot and is now fully restored.

The CM team will continue investigating the issue and will reschedule the upgrade in the near future. We will provide further updates once more information becomes available.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
