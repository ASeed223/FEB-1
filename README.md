Hi Sonatype Support,

This is Shushen from State of California Franchise Tax Board. I am the Nexus Admin in our department. When I try to use the "ftbedrcmteam@ftb.ca.gov" Sonatype account to access the support portal, it showed the "This account is not an authorized support contact." Can you please help us grant access to the support portal? We ran into some issue with our Nexus upgrade, I need access to follow up the ticket. Thanks
