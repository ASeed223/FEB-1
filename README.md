Hi everyone,

The Nexus upgrade has been completed and the system is now up and available for use.

However, we are currently seeing an issue with the Browse feature in the new version. This appears to be a UI/display issue only. All core functions, including pulling images, are working as expected. We have opened a ticket with Sonatype Support and are working with their engineering team to resolve it.

If the Browse issue cannot be resolved, we may consider rolling back. The current snapshot was taken on 02/27 at 8:00 PM, which includes the RHEL OS patches.

I will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as needed.
