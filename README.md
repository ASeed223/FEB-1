Hi Sonatype Support Team,

This is Shushen from the State of California Franchise Tax Board. I am the Nexus Admin for our department.

When I try to use the ftbedrcmteam@ftb.ca.gov
 Sonatype account to access the support portal, I receive the following message: “This account is not an authorized support contact.”

Could you please help grant this account access to the support portal? We are currently experiencing an issue related to our Nexus upgrade, and I need access in order to follow up on the support ticket.

Thank you for your assistance.
