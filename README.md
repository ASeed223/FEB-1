Morning Jay,

I just spoke with James this morning, and it looks like he’s not able to access the IQ server page. I checked the organization access, and James is in the same role as David.

However, it seems like James doesn’t have permission to access the IQ server, as he’s seeing a “can’t reach this page” message. Do you know if James needs to submit an additional ACL request for the IQ server (lxpd196), or if there’s a security group that his supervisor needs to add him to?
