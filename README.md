Good morning everyone,
Yesterday morning I mainly focused on the OCP learning session with Riley, Philip, and Shelly. Thanks to Riley for walking us through everything and helping me refresh my OCP knowledge.

Other than that, I continued configuring the files for the Nexus upgrade. I also noticed that Sonatype released another upgrade just two days ago.

For today, I’ll run the Ansible playbook to upgrade Nexus HA as a test, and plan to apply this update to our current Nexus next week.
That’s my plan for today.
