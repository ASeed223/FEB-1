Yesterday, after the morning meeting, I mainly worked on a simple Ansible playbook to validate that the Nexus service after the upgrade. The playbook checks the network port, Java process, and system APIs. It also confirms data integrity and usability by verifying storage write permissions and performing an end-to-end artifact download test after the upgrade.

Today, I will use that playbook to validate the Nexus upgrade. I will also work on the online help deployment later this afternoon.

That’s my plan for today.
