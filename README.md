The primary goal of this Nexus upgrade is to align the version of our standalone Nexus instance (lxpd195) with the new Nexus HA nodes (lxpd208 and lxpd209). This version parity is a critical prerequisite for our scheduled Nexus HA migration in March. By ensuring both environments are running the same software version, we can guarantee database schema compatibility during the synchronization process, thereby minimizing the risk of data corruption or synchronization errors.
