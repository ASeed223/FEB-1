Hi Sean,

Thanks, I really appreciate it.

If we’re able to patch lxpd194 and lxpd195 first, that would help a lot since we could start the Nexus upgrade earlier and potentially wrap things up sooner for both of us.

Otherwise, if I don’t start the upgrade until 10:53 PM, there’s a chance you might have to wait until after midnight. We would need your help to roll back to the snapshot in case the upgrade fails, so I just want to avoid keeping you online longer than necessary.
