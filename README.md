I’m not 100% sure about this case since my jumpbox isn’t using DHCP, so I’m not sure if others might have a better suggestion.

If possible, I’d recommend submitting the ACL using the IPv4 address that starts with 10.xx.xxx.xxx for now. Once someone starts working on your ACL request, you can follow up directly with them; they may have a better recommendation based on how the ACL is handled.
