Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me.

Yesterday, besides working on a couple of PEGA ZIP deployments to TST3 and DEV3, I mainly focused on updating the IQ scan pipeline to scan the latest branch. I’ve completed all the necessary code changes and will be pushing the code to the repo and running some test runs to make sure everything works as expected.

For today, I’ll also be meeting again with Philip, Riley, and Shelly on Philip’s PBI, and continuing to work on the tasks on my board.

That’s my plan for today.
