Good morning everyone, Last Friday after the morning meetings, I focused on resolving the Apache issue on lxpd195. I was able to use the new SSL certificate to successfully start Apache, and I tested the connection through port 8443 to verify connectivity to Nexus HA.
I also worked on documenting the steps in the wiki on how I configured the SSL certificate in the Apache server. Today, I’ll continue focusing on that. That’s my plan for today.
