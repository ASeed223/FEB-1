Good morning everyone,

Yesterday, besides meetings, I was mainly focused on setting up the secret encryption key in Nexus HA. I was able to successfully configure it and remediate the warning message in Nexus HA. I also started working on a wiki to document the steps for managing the encryption key for future maintenance.

As for today, I will continue working on the wiki and focus on the tasks on my board.

That’s my plan for today.
