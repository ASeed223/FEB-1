Good morning everyone,

Yesterday, I mainly worked on the SSL certificate issue for Apache on lxpd195. It took me some time to figure out the process for generating the SSL request and submitting the ticket to obtain the PEM file for the certificate.

Then later in the afternnon attended the DDP review meeting in the afternoon. Thanks to Philip and Edgar for answering Simon’s questions. Also picked up the Pega ZIP deployment task and worked on the online help deployment as well.

Today, I will continue troubleshooting and fixing the Apache issue on lxpd195.

That’s my plan for today.
