Good morning everyone,

Yesterday, I finished the wiki documentation on how I configured the SSL certificate in the Apache server. After that, I started freeing up disk space on lxpd195 and am still working on it.

I discovered that the current Nexus version is limiting our ability to remove some unused images. I will continue researching possible solutions. If I’m unable to resolve it, I’ll revisit this after the Nexus upgrade scheduled for this Friday.

I also have a couple of meetings to attend today.

That’s my plan for today.
