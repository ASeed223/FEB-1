Good morning everyone,

Yesterday morning, I mainly focused on the Nexus upgrade issue. The upgrade was unsuccessful because the PostgreSQL Trigram extension was missing on lxpd194, which caused Nexus to fail to start. We plan to attempt the upgrade again next Friday during the infrastructure maintenance release window.

I also worked on the Nexus password change and the online help deployment before logging off.

As for today, I will spend some time reviewing the Ansible playbook after the Nexus and cmdeploy password changes to ensure everything is still accessible and functioning properly.

That’s my plan for today.
