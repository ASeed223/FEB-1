Good morning everyone,
Last Friday, I updated a few Ansible Vault entries related to the Nexus password change from last week. I also plan to add these additional steps to the Nexus password update wiki.
Other than that, I granted Nexus access to a couple of Confluent team members.
As for today, I plan to start creating another wiki that includes all the steps needed for a Nexus upgrade for future reference.
That’s my plan for today.
