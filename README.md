Good morning everyone, yesterday I mainly focused on preparing for the Nexus upgrade scheduled for next Thursday. I decided not to use the Ansible playbook since the current Nexus setup has different file paths and login credentials, and doing the upgrade manually should reduce the risk of failure.

I was in the middle of configuring the files but then my jumpbox suddenly disconnected due to the network outage.

As for today, I’ll continue working on the Nexus upgrade and also shadow Riley and Philip on one of the OCP PBIs. That’s my plan for today.
