Good morning everyone, Last Friday morning, I shadowed Chris on the batch client password change task. In the afternoon, I upgraded the Windows Software Development Kit in fp936 and fp1071 to the latest version to remediate the vulnerability. Later that night, I worked on the infrastructure maintenance release and the Nexus upgrade. Overall, the upgrade was successful. As for today, I will continue to monitor in case any issues arise from the upgrade and also continue working on Nexus HA–related tasks. That’s my plan for today.
